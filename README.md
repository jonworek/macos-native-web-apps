Create apps out of webpages using nativefier

There are some common apps I use on the web that I would like to have more
of a native experience with on MacOS.

# Setup

Run `/bin/setup` to install prerequisites.

# Creating apps

Run `./create_apps.sh`. It will which have been defined within that script create apps using nativefier.

The apps will be installed into your computer's /Applications directory.

Once installed, launch the apps just as you would any other application on your computer.
